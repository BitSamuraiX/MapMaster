## 🧠 How It Works

This project was programmed using **Processing (Java mode)**.  
It loads random images (from a folder or URL list), shows them to the player, and lets them pick a spot on a map.  
When you confirm your guess, the game calculates the distance between your guess and the real location — and awards points accordingly.
